<h2>How long have you been a TypeScript developer?</h2>
<p>I have been a software developer for 4 years, with 3 years of experience in TypeScript and 2 years working in the Node.js environment 🙂</p>

<h2>Do you have a preference between front-end and back-end development?</h2>
<p>While I'm comfortable working on both front-end and back-end development, I have a stronger preference for back-end work ⭐</p>

<h2>Do you use design patterns?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. My favorite is dependency injection, and I frequently use other patterns such as singletons, factories, and use-cases 🔥</p>

<h2>How do you ensure that your code is functional, understandable, and usable by other developers?</h2>
<p>I write both unit tests and end-to-end tests to ensure the code works correctly and to prevent regressions when changes are made. Additionally, I make an effort to document the APIs I develop and choose clear, meaningful names for variables and functions 💪</p>

<h2>What is your strategy for continuing to improve your skills?</h2>
<p>I’ve had the opportunity to work in talented teams where I’ve learned a great deal. Between roles, I often work on small personal projects to familiarize myself with new frameworks and libraries. I also regularly watch tutorials online when I want to dive into new topics 🤓</p>

<h2>Are you familiar with any cloud services?</h2>
<p>Yes, I have significant experience with Amazon Web Services, particularly serverless services like Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and SQS, which I used in my last role. I also worked with AWS's Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to manage infrastructure as code 🚀</p>

<h2>Do you have any specific skills in DevOps?</h2>
<p>I have a strong interest in DevOps, as it enables time-saving and efficiency improvements. I’m particularly eager to gain more hands-on experience with containerization using Docker and automating CI/CD pipelines for faster deployments 🛳️</p>

<h2>Anything else to add?</h2>
<p>Although my role is highly technical, I never lose sight of the fact that my work ultimately serves the end user. I always maintain a user-centered approach when developing solutions, ensuring they address real needs effectively 🧡</p>
